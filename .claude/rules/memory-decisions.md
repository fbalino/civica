# Project Memory Decisions

- Government classification now uses three layers:
  - raw CIA Factbook label kept unchanged on `jurisdictions.government_type_detail`
  - normalized Bjornskov-Rode / CGV regime layer stored in `government_taxonomies`
  - derived structural form layer stored in `government_taxonomies`
- Structural form is the default public lens on `/civica-index/government-types`.
- Regime type is available as a second lens and is metadata only. It does not affect CI scoring.
- Switzerland is treated as a deliberate divergence case:
  - regime lens: presidential democracy
  - structural lens: federal directorial republic

### Chat context scoping rule (Ask Civica)
The `contextChips` shown in the right-pane chat AND the `apiContext` sent to `/api/chat`
must only include state variables that are semantically relevant to the active tab.

House (upper/lower) is only meaningful on the `chamber` and `bills` tabs. It must be
stripped from both chips and apiContext when tab ∈ {structure, elections, democracy,
leaders, constitution, international}.

Why: the current Atlas sends noisy state to the model — e.g. on `/atlas/usa/democracy`
the chat was sending `{house: "lower"}` even though Democracy is a country-level view.
The model then has to ignore irrelevant context, which degrades answer quality.

How to apply:
```ts
const tabNeedsHouse = tab === "chamber" || tab === "bills";
const contextChips = [
  { label: "Country", value: country.name },
  ...(tabNeedsHouse ? [{ label: "House", value: houseLabel }] : []),
  { label: "Tab", value: TAB_LABELS[tab] },
];
const apiContext = {
  country: country.name,
  tab,
  ...(tabNeedsHouse ? { house } : {}),
};
```

The URL's `?house=` query param is NOT stripped for non-chamber tabs — it is preserved
so navigating back to Chamber restores the user's previous choice. Only the chat
context is filtered. This same principle applies to any future per-tab context
(e.g. a future `currentBillId` should only appear on the bills tab).

## 2026-04-24 — Phase 2.1 extraction plan locked

- `?house=upper` is a URL search param, NOT a path segment. Avoids rebuilding three
  panes on chamber toggle.
- `BillCard.onAsk` cross-coupling (currently writes to `chatInputRef` directly) is
  being replaced by a `civica:ask` CustomEvent on `window`. `AskCivicaPanel` listens
  (gated by `listenForExternalAsk` prop) and pre-fills. This is the clean pattern
  when chat lives in a separate route slot from the trigger.
- International tab routes by 3-letter `country.id`, NOT by slug (see AtlasApp.tsx:763,
  comment at :761). Every other tab uses slug. `InternationalTab` props should name
  the field `countryId` to make the deviation explicit at call sites.
- Per-route defaults do NOT cascade through segment boundaries in Next.js 16 parallel
  routes. Every depth under `(shell)/atlas/` needs its own `@left/page.tsx` and
  `@right/page.tsx`, not just the root.
- Filter state (`searchQuery`, `regionFilter`, `govFilter`) stays owned by `AtlasApp`
  for the legacy `/` route because `setAtlasControls` at lines 359–415 reads them to
  inject into the global header. `AtlasCountryLeft` receives them as props, does not
  own them.
